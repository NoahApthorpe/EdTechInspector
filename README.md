# Ed Tech Leak Inspector

This is a Chrome extension for an in-progress research study by Colgate University, the University of Chicago, NYU, and York University. 

We are studying the privacy implications of educational technology websites used by K-12 school districts.

The code is an adapted version of the [Leak Inspector](https://github.com/leaky-forms/leak-inspector) software in manifest v3.
